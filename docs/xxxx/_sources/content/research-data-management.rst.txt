Research Data Management
------------------------

What are research data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Research data include experimentally captured data sets, processed data, and
data computed through computer simulation. The software involved in these steps
*and* meta-data that describes the data are also research data.

Research data is created in virtually any research activity.

What is research data management?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Research data management includes the storing of data so that it can be actively
worked on by the owner, sharing of the data with collaborators, and long term
archiving of (important parts of) the data. The organisation and documentation
of the data is also part of research data management. For published data, the
documentation should be to such a standard that other researchers can understand
and re-use the data.

Why do we need research data management?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good research data management enables effective use of the data by the
creator/owner, verification or reproduction of published research outputs, and
re-use of the data leading to new results.

Research data management is part of good scientific practice.

Funding bodies, scientific journals and research organisations (such as the Max
Planck Society) are increasingly demanding pro-active data management from
applicants, authors and employers.

Research data life cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most research projects, there are different stages of working with the
relevant research data:

Stage 1: data capture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initially, *data is captured* (for example through experiment or computer
simulation), and iteratively refined: output from first *initial analysis* of the data may
guide the experiment or choice of simulation parameters that lead to the next
data set recorded.

Stage 2: data analysis towards publication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This data capture phase is followed by identification of the most interesting
parts of the data, and then an in-depth *data analysis* of those data sets leading
(in many cases) to a publication.

Stage 1 and 2 may merge into each other, for example if the
experiment/simulation is available without time limitation and further data
capture can be carried out following the analysis.

During stage 1 and 2, we need access to the data sets with a short latency.
Typically, such data is stored "on disk" (in particular not on tape).

Stage 3: post publication and data archival
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*After publication* important data should be kept (see :doc:`archive`).

For economic reasons, such *archived data* is commonly stored on tape. This means
access to the data is slow: it may take minutes, hours or days to get the data
back from tape into a system where it can be read and re-processed.

Research data associated with a publication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To publish scientific results that make use of data (in some form), one should
create a data repository for this publication which puts together (somehow) and
archives (somehow) the important information that is required to *reproduce* the
findings from the publication manuscript.

      Simulation research data

      Where the data is computed by a simulation, it is crucial to keep a precise
      record of the version of the simulation and post-processing software (typically
      using :doc:`version-control`).
