KEEPER - "archive the way you work"
-----------------------------------

.. note:: The section below assumes you are an employee of the `Max Planck Society <https://mpg.de>`__. 

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Keeper allows cloud synchronisation of data with local machine (similar to Dropbox
  if the 'drive client' is used)

- Data is organised into 'libraries'

- Libraries can be shared with others

- Files can be made available publicly through a link

- Data will be archived (`for at least 10 years <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/1b0bfceac2/>`_)

- turn libraries into archives

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important::

    - home page URL: `https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_

      - shows some documentation links while logged out

      - shows overview of libraries and files in browser when logged in

    - Additional documentation at `https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper>`_

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

KEEPER organizes files into libraries. Each library can be synced and shared
separately. One personal library is created on on sign-up. You can create more
libraries later.

Getting data into KEEPER (SeaDrive)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web interface (keeper.mpld.mpg.de) allows to see data and upload files and folders.

More convenient access is realised through `keeper clients <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007791160-Keeper-Drive-Client>`_.

It appears that Seafile/seadrive is used for keeper. If you have a choice
between 'desktop client (seafile)' and 'drive client (seadrive)' when
installing, then the latter seems to be the more recent development (which is
described here), which provides the Dropbox-like behaviour of automatically
syncing selected files with the local machine.

Sharing access to Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries can be shared between multiple people.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email notifications about changed files can be requested (for example to be sent
every day, or every 4 hours). This can be helpful when working on a shared
library.

Usage experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Warning::

    Moving files (for example into a subdirectory) within a directory on a local machine
    using the SeaDrive client (tested with OSX), results in deletion and re-upload
    of the files to the Cloud. This could take a long time for large files.

    So the lesson is: best to put files into the right place immediately (if the
    amount of data is large and upload times are long), or to drive such operations
    through the web interface.

Please share your observations! (Contact :doc:`introduction`)


.. todo::

    - TODO

      - test archiving files

        - can we delete the archive again later?

      - stop synching particular folders
