.. note:: The section below assumes you are an employee of the `Max Planck Society <https://mpg.de>`__. 

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Keeper provides disk space (in the cloud and provided by the Max Planck
  Digital Library), that can be archived.

- Data is organised into `Libraries`_ (i.e. top level folders represent libraries)

- An overview of all the libraries is available through a web browser at the keeper home page (`https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_)

- Keeper allows upload of large files or directories

- Keeper allows cloud synchronisation of data with local machine

- Access to librariers with other MPG researchers can be managed through `Sharing
  Libraries or Folders <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007710419-Sharing-Files-and-Folders>`_

- Subdirectories and files and can be made available publicly through a `share link <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007710419-Sharing-Files-and-Folders>`_

- Sharing is possible with MPG researchers and `external collaborators <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008395899-How-to-invite-external-collaborators-to-Keeper>`_

- Libraries can be turned into archives

- `DOIs can be created if desired <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010502479-Digital-Object-Identifier-DOI->`_

- Data will be archived for at least 10 years (`see "Cared Data Committment" <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/1b0bfceac2/>`_)

- provides a `"Cared Data Certificate" <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/lib/70815673-26f2-4d36-873b-76b8262a6cf9/file/Cared-Data-Certificate-HowTo.pdf>`_

- `Use as Google-docs alternative for real time collaborative document authoring <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017369119-Office-in-Keeper-Web-OnlyOffice>`_

Quota (data size)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The amount of storage for each user is 1TB (by default). 

Quota is counted by looking at the size of the libraries associated to the owner
of the libraries. Each library has exactly one owner.

By sharing libraries with others, this does not contribute to the data quote of the others.

Keeper is not designed to archive significantly larger amounts of data. (As of Jan 2021.)

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important::

    - Keeper home page URL: `https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_

      - shows some documentation links while logged out

      - shows overview of libraries and files in browser when logged in

    - Additional documentation at `https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper>`_

    - One needs to subscribe to use the service and define a new password that is
      required to connect the SeaLife or SeaDrive clients to Keeper, or when logging
      in to the Keeper home page (`https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_)

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

KEEPER organises files into 'libraries'. Each library can be synced and shared
separately. One personal library is created on sign-up. You can create more
libraries later.

Getting data into KEEPER (SeaFile)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web interface at `https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_ allows to see all the data in
keeper, including libraries, shared libraries, all the directory structures and
files.

More convenient access is realised through `keeper clients <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007791160-Keeper-Drive-Client>`_.

SeaFile
^^^^^^^

SeaFile can be used to upload files (or whole directories) from the local
storage system to Keeper, or to download files from keeper to the local machine.

It is also possible to 'sync' local folders with those in Keeper: any change in
one of the files on the local machine will (in the background) be repeated in
Keeper's storage.

This is convenient to have a synchronised copy of the data at a different
location, while working on the data.

Note that you need to `Unsync`_ such synchronised data before you delete it locally
(other wise the copy in Keeper will also be deleted).

SeaDrive
^^^^^^^^

Is a more recent client than SeaFile. It is currently not as stable as SeaFile,
and usage of SeaFile is recommended (as of Jan 2021).

.. note:: Experience reports are welcome regarding practical data upload and synchronisation.

Unsync
^^^^^^

When you have synchronised a local folder with Keeper, and want to delete the
local folder but keep the copy in Keeper, you need to `unsync <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007744619-Unsync-and-Resync-Libraries>`_ that folder before
deleting it.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email notifications about changed files can be requested (for example to be sent
every day, or every 4 hours). This can be helpful when working on a shared
library.

Usage experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Warning::

    Moving files (for example into a subdirectory) within a directory on a local machine
    using the SeaDrive client (tested with OSX), results in deletion and re-upload
    of the files to the Cloud. This could take a long time for large files.

    So the lesson is: best to put files into the right place immediately (if the
    amount of data is large and upload times are long), or to drive such operations
    through the web interface.

Please share your observations! (Contact :doc:`introduction`)
