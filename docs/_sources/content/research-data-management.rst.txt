Research Data Management
------------------------

What are research data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Research data include experimentally captured data sets, processed data, and
data computed through computer simulation. The software involved in these steps
*and* meta-data that describes the data are also research data.

Research data is created in virtually any research activity.

What is research data management?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Research data management includes the storing of data so that it can be actively
worked on by the owner, sharing of the data with collaborators, and long term
archiving of (important parts of) the data. The organisation and documentation
of the data is also part of research data management. For published data, the
documentation should be to such a standard that other researchers can understand
and re-use the data.

Why do we need research data management?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good research data management enables effective use of the data by the
creator/owner, verification or reproduction of published research outputs, and
re-use of the data leading to new results.

Research data management is part of good scientific practice.

Funding bodies, scientific journals and research organisations (such as the Max
Planck Society) are increasingly demanding pro-active data management from
applicants, authors and employers.

Research data life cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most research projects, there are different stages of working with the
relevant research data:

Stage 1: data capture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initially, *data is captured* (for example through experiment or computer
simulation), and iteratively refined: output from first *initial analysis* of the data may
guide the experiment or choice of simulation parameters that lead to the next
data set recorded.

Stage 2: data analysis towards publication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This data capture phase is followed by identification of the most interesting
parts of the data, and then an in-depth *data analysis* of those data sets leading
(in many cases) to a publication.

Stage 1 and 2 may merge into each other, for example if the
experiment/simulation is available without time limitation and further data
capture can be carried out following the analysis.

During stage 1 and 2, we need access to the data sets with a short latency.
Typically, such data is stored "on disk" (in particular not on tape).

Stage 3: post publication and data archival
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*After publication* important data should be kept (see :doc:`archive`).

For economic reasons, such *archived data* is commonly stored on tape. This means
access to the data is slow: it may take minutes, hours or days to get the data
back from tape into a system where it can be read and re-processed.

Research data associated with a publication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To publish scientific results that make use of data (in some form), one should
create a data repository for this publication which puts together (somehow) and
archives (somehow) the important information that is required to *reproduce* the
findings from the publication manuscript.

    - Put important and small documents into :doc:`version-control`.

      Simulation research data

      Where the data is computed by a simulation, it is crucial to keep a precise
      record of the version of the simulation and post-processing software (typically
      using :doc:`version-control`).

Dealing with data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MPLD summarises some guidance on `naming and handling files <https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de/file-handling/>`_.

Small and important files should be kept under :doc:`version-control`.

During data capture and data analysis, it is desirable to have backups of the
data files to be ready to respond to unexpected hardware failure or user error
(such as accidentally deleting important data files). Depending on the file
size, this may or may not be possible.

For medium sized projects (below 500GB), the :doc:`keeper` project from
the MPDL can be used here (using the SeaDrive client). Keeper can also turn such
a collection of files into an archive when the project is completed.

[To have a backup of local data in the cloud, MPG researchers can also use the
`GWDG OwnCloud <https://www.gwdg.de/storage-services/gwdg-owncloud>`_ solution for small data sets. By default, this provides 50GB
of storage. In contrast to Keeper, there is no associated archival foreseen.]

For very large data sets, such as those captured at X-ray Free Electron Lasers
or synchrotrons, the relevant research facility is normally equipped to host the
data on the research facility site, and provides computational storage to carry
out (at least the initial) analysis on site. 

File formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

General guidance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MPLD summarises some guidance on `file formats <https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de/file-formats>`_. 

A lot of thought and planning can go into choosing a suitable file format to
keep the data of a research project. In the rare case of starting a research
project where there are existing standard or legacy file formats or conventions,
one should choose file formats that are feasible and convenient to assess in the
future. 

There are a number metrics that can be optimised in choosing such suitable file
format. These include: simplicity, human-readability, compression, write speed,
read speed, accessibility on different platforms, open documentation, widespread
adoption in the community, number of files and open source. Please seek advice
if desired.

In addition to storing data in the files, we also need to document the meaning
of the stored data (i.e. provide metadata to make the data interpretable).

Domain specific file formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some communities have created domain specific data file formats that are *self describing* and - through this design - *embed the metadata* automatically.

For example:

- NeXuS - Common data format for neutron, x-ray and muon science (`https://www.nexusformat.org <https://www.nexusformat.org>`_)

- openPMD - OPEN stand for Particle-Mesh Data files (`https://www.hzdr.de/publications/Publ-27962 <https://www.hzdr.de/publications/Publ-27962>`_, `https://www.openpmd.org <https://www.openpmd.org>`_)

If you can use such a self-describing file format (or develop your own), this
simplifies creating meaningful archival of the data.

It provides other benefits: all data sets using the same file format can be
processed by data analysis tools that support the file format.
