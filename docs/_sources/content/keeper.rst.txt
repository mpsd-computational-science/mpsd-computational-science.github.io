Keeper (archiving tool and more)
--------------------------------

.. note:: The section below assumes you are an employee of the `Max Planck Society <https://mpg.de>`__. 

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Keeper provides disk space (in the cloud and provided by the Max Planck Digital Library), that can be archived.

- Data is organised into 'libraries' (i.e. top level folders represent libraries)

- An overview of all the libraries is available through a web browser at the keeper home page (`https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_)

- Libraries can be shared with others

- Keeper allows upload of large files or directories (using the 'SeeLife' client)

- Keeper allows cloud synchronisation of data with local machine (similar to Dropbox
  if the 'SeaDrive' client is used)

- Files can be made available publicly through a link

- Libraries can be turned into archives

- DOIs can be created if desired

- Data will be archived for at least 10 years (`see "Cared Data Committment" <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/1b0bfceac2/>`_)

- provides a `"Cared Data Certificate" <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/lib/70815673-26f2-4d36-873b-76b8262a6cf9/file/Cared-Data-Certificate-HowTo.pdf>`_

Getting started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Important::

    - Keeper home page URL: `https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_

      - shows some documentation links while logged out

      - shows overview of libraries and files in browser when logged in

    - Additional documentation at `https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001234340-Keeper>`_

    - One needs to subscribe to use the service and define a new password that is
      required to connect the SeaLife or SeaDrive clients to Keeper, or when logging
      in to the Keeper home page (`https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de <https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de>`_)

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

KEEPER organises files into 'libraries'. Each library can be synced and shared
separately. One personal library is created on sign-up. You can create more
libraries later.

Getting data into KEEPER (SeaDrive)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web interface (keeper.mpld.mpg.de) allows to see data and upload files and folders.

More convenient access is realised through `keeper clients <https://mpdl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007791160-Keeper-Drive-Client>`_.

- SeaFile: For upload of large files or directories, SeaFile appears to be the
  right choice.

- SeaDrive: can be used to synchronise local files with files in Keeper. It
  appears this could be used while working on a project (for example to have a
  backup in the Keeper cloud), and to be able to turn the whose library into
  archive when the work is completed.

.. note:: Experience reports are welcome regarding practical data upload and synchronisation.

Sharing access to Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries can be shared between multiple people.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email notifications about changed files can be requested (for example to be sent
every day, or every 4 hours). This can be helpful when working on a shared
library.

Usage experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Warning::

    Moving files (for example into a subdirectory) within a directory on a local machine
    using the SeaDrive client (tested with OSX), results in deletion and re-upload
    of the files to the Cloud. This could take a long time for large files.

    So the lesson is: best to put files into the right place immediately (if the
    amount of data is large and upload times are long), or to drive such operations
    through the web interface.

Please share your observations! (Contact :doc:`introduction`)


.. todo::

    - TODO

      - test archiving files

        - can we delete the archive again later?

      - stop synching particular folders
