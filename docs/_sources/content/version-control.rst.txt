Version control
---------------

Version control refers to the process of systematically storing important versions of documents for the future.

A typical tool to achieve this is ``~git~``.

Documents that should be put under version control include:

- computer source code for simulation software and

- computer source code for analysis scripts

- configuration files

- metadata

We also recommend to put important documents into version control, such as the
manuscript of a publication, and a PhD thesis.
