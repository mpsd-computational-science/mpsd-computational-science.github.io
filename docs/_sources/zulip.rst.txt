Introduction
------------

Zulip provides chat for distributed teams. It `can be argued that chat
is a useful communication
mode <https://fangohr.github.io/blog/zulip.html>`__ for organisations,
in particular in COVID times where remote work maybe unavoidable.

MPSD
----

We have a Zulip chat organisation for the Max Planck Institute for the
Structure and Dynamics of Matter available at https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de
.

  The Zulip service is experimental, so please do not rely on it as an archive for
  important information as it may be discontinued or fail.

How to get started?
-------------------

All the important information is available in Zulip's help on `Getting
started with
Zulip <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/getting-started-with-zulip>`__.

We summarise some key points:

Streams and topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One important topic to understand is that of *Streams* and *topics*.

The conversations are arranged into *streams*. There are some default
streams that everybody will join such as ``general``, ``random`` and
``zulip-help``. Within each stream, there is a (growing) list of
*topics*. Each topic gathers multiple messages belonging to that topic.

See `Zulip's help on streams and
topics <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/about-streams-and-topics>`__.

Public and private streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are public streams, and private streams.

Private streams are useful to contain discussions within one group or
department, such as the ``theory`` department or the IT group. Only
invited members can see the stream.

If you would like to create a private stream for your group/department,
please get in touch with zulip-admin@mpsd.mpg.de .

You can leave public streams, such as ``general``, ``random`` and
``zulip-help`` if you are not interested in those, or change the
notification settings.

Public streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``#general``: use for questions or announcements of general
   interested and work-related content (for example a seminar
   announcements, questions about onboarding, etc)

-  ``#random``: use for non-work related exchange; this can be a
   substitute for coffee table discussions: looking for a plumber,
   suggesting a BBQ, discussing the weather or sports or computers etcâ€¦

-  ``#zulip-help``: use to ask for help in matters regarding use of
   Zulip

-  ``#ssu-cs``: Scientific Support Unit Computational Science - feel
   free to use this stream to informally ask questions regarding
   Computational problems: high performance computing, data analysis and
   visualisation. If there is an easy answer available, this could be a
   fast way of getting it. (Or find that somebody else has asked the
   same question in the past.)

If you cannot see one of these streams, click on `Subscribe to more
streams <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/#streams/all>`__ to see which ones
are accessible.

Private streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some private streams (for research groups, PhD students etc) -
you need to be invited to those by a member of the relevant stream
before you can see them.

Sending messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can post messages in a stream (so everybody in the stream can see
the message), or you can `send a private message to another
person <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/private-messages>`__ (or a group
of other people). Such private messages have no topics.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can decide what kind of
`Notifications <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/#notifications>`__ you
would like to receive when new messages arrive. This can be configured
for streams or for individual topics only.

Muting topics/streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are too many messages on a topic of no interest, you can *mute*
that topic or stream (see
`Notifications <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/#notifications>`__).

Desktop and smartphone apps
---------------------------

There are `Zulip apps for Linux, OSX, Windows Android, iOS and the
terminal <https://zulip.com/apps/mac>`__ available.
