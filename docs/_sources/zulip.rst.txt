Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zulip provides chat for distributed teams. It `can be argued that chat is a
useful communication mode <https://fangohr.github.io/blog/zulip.html>`_ for organisations, in particular in COVID times where
remote work maybe unavoidable.

We have a Zulip chat organisation for the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and
Dynamics of Matter available at `https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de>`_ .

  The Zulip service is experimental, so please do not rely on it as an archive for
  important information as it may be discontinued or fail.

How to get started?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the important information is available in Zulip's help on `Getting started with Zulip <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/getting-started-with-zulip>`_.

We summarise some key points:

Streams and topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One important topic to understand is that of *Streams* and *topics*.

The conversations are arranged into *streams*. There are some default streams that
everybody will join such as ``general``, ``random`` and ``zulip-help``. Within each stream,
there is a (growing) list of *topics*. Each topic gathers multiple messages
belonging to that topic.

See `Zulip's help on streams and topics <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/about-streams-and-topics>`_.

Public and private  streams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are public streams, and private streams.

Private streams are useful to contain discussions within one group or
department, such as the ``theory`` department or the IT group. Only invited members
can see the stream.

If you would like to create a private stream for your
group/department, please get in touch with zulip-admin@mpsd.mpg.de .

You can leave public streams, such as ``general``, ``random`` and ``zulip-help`` if you are
not interested in those, or change the notification settings.

Public streams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``#general``: use for announcements of general interested to everybody in the institute with professional content (for example a seminar announcements)

- ``#random``: use for non-work related exchange; this can be a substitute for coffee table discussions.

- ``#zulip-help``: use to ask for help in matters regarding use of Zulip

Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can decide what kind of `Notifications <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/#notifications>`_ you would like to receive when new messages arrive. 

Sending messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can post messages in a stream (so everybody in the stream can see the message), or you can `send a private message to another person <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de/help/private-messages>`_ (or a group of other people). Such private messages have no topics.
