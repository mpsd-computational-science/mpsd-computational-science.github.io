Introduction
============

You are reading the resources pages of the `Computational Science scientific support unit <https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/research/ssus/computational-science>`__
at the
`Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter <https://mpsd.mpg.de>`__ in
Hamburg, Germany.

The material here is meant to provide some guidance for research involving
computation. However, the field of computational science, underpinning
experimental and theoretical research, is relatively new and developing quickly.
So whatever (opinionated?) views are expressed here, may not be applicable to
your research challenge, outdated or simply wrong:

Please do `get in touch <https://mpsd-computational-science.github.io/about.html#contact>`__
with any corrections, ideas, need for clarifications and support requests.

Researchers outside the `MPSD <https://mpsd.mpg.de>`__ are welcome to use these
resources, and are invited to provide feedback for improvements.


About these pages
-----------------

These pages are put together using the `sphinx documentation system
<http://sphinx-doc.org>`__, and are hosted using `GitHub pages
<https://pages.github.com>`__.

You can navigate the pages using the cursor keys: cursor to the left and right
will jump from section to section. Cursors keys up and down scroll the current
page.

The side-bar on the left can be collapsed by clicking on the bar separating it
from the main panel.

.. note::

  - This is work in progress.
  - More material and pages will be added.
  - Please approach us to indicate what is of highest importance for your work.
