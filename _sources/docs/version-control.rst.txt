Version control
===============

Version control refers to the process of systematically storing
important versions of documents for the future.

A typical tool to achieve this is ``~git~``.

Documents that should be put under version control include:

-  computer source code for simulation software and
-  computer source code for analysis scripts
-  configuration files
-  metadata

We also recommend to put important documents into version control, such
as the manuscript of a publication, and a PhD thesis.

For MPG researchers, the `GWDG Gitlab
Service <https://www.gwdg.de/e-mail-collaboration/gitlab>`__ can be used
to host git repositories in the cloud.
