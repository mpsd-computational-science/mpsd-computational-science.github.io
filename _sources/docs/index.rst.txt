You are looking at the resources pages of the `Computational Science scientific
support unit <../about.html>`__ at the
`Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter
<https://mpsd.mpg.de>`__ in Hamburg, Germany.

..
   The material here is meant to provide some guidance for research involving
   computation. See :doc:`introduction`.

The material here is meant to provide some guidance for research involving
computation. However, the field of computational science, underpinning
experimental and theoretical research, is relatively new and developing quickly.
So whatever (opinionated?) views are expressed here, may not be applicable to
your research challenge, outdated or simply wrong:

Please do `get in touch <https://mpsd-computational-science.github.io/about.html#contact>`__
with any corrections, ideas, need for clarifications and support requests.

Researchers outside the `MPSD <https://mpsd.mpg.de>`__ are welcome to use these
resources, and are invited to provide feedback for improvements.


About these pages
-----------------
