Research Software Engineer for Data Science and High Performance Computing
==========================================================================

Introduction
------------

Interested in how scientists write and use software to analyse and visualise
data? Run simulations and make their work reproducible? Use laptops,
workstations and HPC systems to support their work?

If so, you may be interested in the recently established `Scientific Support Unit for Computational
Science <index.html>`__ at the `Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics
of Matter <https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en>`__ : We combine research software
engineering services with research into computational science.

Our mission is to provide our scientific colleagues a mixture of training,
support, and collaborative work in computational matters to enable and
contribute to leading edge scientific research in the respective fields of the
scientists - typically in physics and material science.

The unit provides a `High Performance Computing (HPC) <docs/hpc.html>`__ installation, and supports
software engineering for simulation and data analysis, data science and
visualization. Your tasks include the software development for simulation, for
data-analysis and visualisation, some system administration, and the delivery of
training to students and staff.

Collaboration with scientists of the institute takes a key role. The SSU group
researches computational methods and infrastructures to stay at the forefront of
computational science.


Our Job
-------

We are looking for a highly motivated and dynamic person to work on scientific
software development. The ideal candidate should have a university degree
(master) in computer science, physics or related fields, and the ability to work
and collaborate within a diverse team.

Essential skills and expertise
##############################

- in-depth Python knowledge, including libraries relevant for numeric computation and data analysis
- good knowledge of a compiled language (such as C, C++, Fortran)
- enthusiasm for good software engineering methods (such as version control, testing, CI)
- talented communicator in English (German skills are welcome but not required)
- experience working as a researcher or as a software engineer 
- performance engineering experience (such as making existing software faster or more memory efficient)
- High Performance Computing experience as a user
- willingness to work interdisciplinary and acquire new skills

Additional desirable skills and experience
##########################################

Any of the following is a benefit, but none are essential:

- Linux system administration
- machine learning
- experience designing or contributing to open source software
- use of GPUs or other acceleration hardware
- experience designing and delivering training on computational topics
- experience working with large data sets (for example hdf5)
- photon science, condensed matter, or computational magnetism experience


Why work for the Max Planck Society - Our offer
-----------------------------------------------

You will be part of a team of scientists and engineers with complementary and
overlapping experience, and work in multiple interdisciplinary collaborations to
advance science. Training on the job is offered and expected - computational
science is a quickly moving field.

We offer an innovative and well funded environment, providing time and trust to
support the best scientists with the best computational science to carry out
curiosity-driven research. [See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZFyD8kSaIo&t=1s

The Computational Science unit in the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and
the Dynamics of Matter is embedded in the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science
(CFEL), and well connected with the `Max-Planck Compute and Data Facility <https://mpcdf.mpg.de>`__,
national and international networks such as the research software engineering
community, and further collaboration partners.

We offer an attractive remuneration up to TVÃ¶D E12 according to the German
public pay scale. The appointment is for two years with the possibility to be
made permanent subsequently.

You find the home page of the unit at http://mpsd-computational-science.github.io . Please get in touch informally
with questions you may have before applying (hans.fangohr@mpsd.mpg.de).
