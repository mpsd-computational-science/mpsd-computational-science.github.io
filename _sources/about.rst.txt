About
=====

You are looking at the home page of the the `Computational Science scientific support unit <https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/research/ssus/computational-science>`__
at the
`Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter <https://mpsd.mpg.de>`__ in
Hamburg, Germany.


Mission
=======

Many scientists need to use computational methods to support their work: ranging
from processing and plotting of experimentally captured data to running
large-scale simulations on high performance computing hardware.

Our mission is to support scientist with these activities. Our services range
from providing help for small enquiries to long-term collaboration to jointly
tackle more ambitious goals.

Our aim is to enable MPSD scientists to use state-of-the-art computational and
software engineering techniques that (i) make the research process more
effective, more flexible and more reproducible, and (ii) are acceptable and
appropriate for the computing skills/interest of the scientists.

Our research activity is in the area of computation for science, including
software engineering for science, workflows for data analysis, visualisation,
and computer simulation methodology. Our work is driven by collaboration with
domain specialists - please get in touch to explore options.


How can we help? - Example activities
=====================================

Do /get in touch/ if any of the following topics are of interested to you:

- How to manage different versions of your analysis scripts / software? (Version control)
- How to work together with others on software? (version control, github/gitlab)
- How to worry less about breaking existing functionality when you extend/change software (automatic tests, continuous integration)
- Can I automate my analysis done in Excel / Origin / ... ?
- My program or data analysis is too slow - what can be done?
- Consider making your software open source? 
- How to visualise my data?
- How to make my data analysis more reproducible?
- Do you need to move your calculations to a high performance computing resource?
- Are you planning a new piece of software and would like to brainstorm a structure?
- Would you like to refactor your software to be more maintainable and usable in the future?
- ...

We can help to with the above (and other) questions: we can discuss the problem
at hand, try to find a solution that is appropriate for your team, provide
relevant training and advice, or take an active role in implementing the
solution.

Contact
=======

There are multiple ways of getting in touch:

- by email, please use `ssu-cs@mpsd.mpg.de <mailto:ssu-cs@mpsd.mpg.de>`_ for general queries

- You can also use the ``#computing`` stream in `MPSD's Zulip instance
  <https://zulip.mpsd.mpg.de>`__ to raise queries, or browse if your question
  was discussed (and answered?) before.

- Of course you can contact group members directly (by Email, Zulip or in person)
