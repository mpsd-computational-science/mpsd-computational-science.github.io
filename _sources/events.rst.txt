2021-09-20 Introduction to Octopus code Advanced topics - 1 week intensive course
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research software has become an essential tool in modern science.
Despite this, often scientist only have basic training in programming,
missing important aspects of modern software development and
engineering. In this course we will present key ideas, tools and
techniques used by researchers to develop robust, efficient codes in a
collaborative environment. This will be done in the context of the
Octopus code (https://octopus-code.org). The philosophy of the Octopus
code is to be a platform which allows to implement new scientific ideas
with relative ease. The code has a modular structure and to a large
extend hides numerical nitty-gritties at a lower level, allowing
researchers to write new modules without the necessity to touch those
low level parts. The code is actively developed with strict quality
control. In this second part of the course, the participants will learn
everything necessary to contribute to the Octopus development, and to
implement new scientific ideas.

Topics include:

-  Advanced version control in a collaborative environment (merge
   requests, code review, etc)
-  Advanced topics of git (merge, rebase, etc)
-  Regression testing and continuous integration
-  Object oriented programming
-  Parallelization and performance

As an outlook this course also provides an overview of current
state-of-the-art scientific problems with Octopus. Also, the second part
will last for one week, with a mixture of lectures and demonstration, as
well as hands-on sessions to try the learned concepts.

2021-09-06 Introduction to Octopus - 1 week intensive course
------------------------------------------------------------

Density functional theory (DFT) and its time dependent variant,
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), are tools of choice to simulate microscopic
processes in nature. This, however, requires powerful numerical tools to
solve the underlying equations and perform simulations of relevant
physical processes. In his course we will give an introduction on how
the DFT and TD-DFT equations can be solved numerically on a computer,
with plently of practical examples using the Octopus code
(https://octopus-code.org). Octopus is a real-space DFT code, geared
mainly at the real-time propagation of time-dependent systems. Besides
introducing the code and highlighting its functionalities, a set of
hands-on tutorials will allow the students to learn how to set up the
system, run ground-state and time-dependent calculations.

Topics include:

-  Ground-state calculations and total energy convergence
-  Model systems
-  Real-time propagation
-  Optical absorption

Throughout the course, it will be emphasized how to check the results
for numerical convergence, but also for computational efficiency.

2021-08-04 19:00 Software Engineering Challenges and Best Practices for Multi-Institutional Scientific Software Development
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of the webinar on HPC best practices
(https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/).
Registration at link is required.

Presenter is Keith Beattie from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/idf/staff/keith-beattie/).
Here is the summary:

Scientific software is increasingly becoming the backbone of obtaining
and validating scientific results. This is no longer just the case for
traditionally computationally intensive areas but is now true across a
wide variety of scientific disciplines. This circumstance elevates how
scientific software is developed, independent of the field, to a new
level of importance. Further, the multi-institutional nature of many
science projects presents unique challenges to how scientific software
can be effectively developed and maintained over the long term. In this
webinar we present the challenges faced in leading the development of
scientific software across a distributed, multi-institutional team of
contributors, and we describe a set of best-practices we have found to
be effective in producing impactful and trustworthy scientific software.

2020-11-04 Open Science COVID19 Analysis
----------------------------------------

Presenter: Hans Fangohr

The Open Science COVID Analysis (OSCOVIDA) project provides an open
science portal at https://oscovida.github.io/ to display and investigate
the COVID19 infections and deaths as a function of time for the US
states, the districts in Germany, and most other countries in the world.
For each region, different observables are shown as a function of time:
total infections and deaths, daily changes, the reproduction number and
growth factor, and doubling times; this can be normalised by the
population of the relevant region. Data sources are currently the Johns
Hopkins University and the Robert Koch Institute. All the source code
that creates the plots is open source, and provides a Python library to
simplify download of current data and population numbers, and
computation and display of the COVID tracking plots available on the
website. The system is based on Jupyter notebooks, which users can
execute in their browser (using the MyBinder project) to adapt the
analysis to their own interests, or base additional studies on top of
the framework. Some tutorials and additional data analysis studies are
available, and further contributions are welcome.
